# data-zero-unofficial

about creator:
I am learning how to code using The Odin Project and I made this unofficial website for data zero as a part of project 2
in The Odin Project. As of writing this I have only learned html and css basics so I apologize if some things are missing,
 out of place, and the messy code. I welcome any feedback and ways that you think that I can improve my code, feel free to 
 reach out to me on the Data Zero discord, username Frontman.
